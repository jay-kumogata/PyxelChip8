## Remarks

This game has been developed by changing characters of Octo's [deep8](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/tree/gh-pages/examples).

Refer to the following URLs for Amabie (*1) and Ofuda (*2). 
Now in Japan, Amabie has been a character to overcome the COVID-19. 
I hope it will subside and the Tokyo Olympics will be held.
