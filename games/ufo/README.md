## How to Controll

## Remarks

I converted an old game called [ufo](https://github.com/badlogic/chip8/blob/master/roms/sources/UFO.SRC) to octo assembly language.
In the original, the label name was written as an address, but as a result of changing it to a label name that makes sense, 
the readability of the source list has improved dramatically.
