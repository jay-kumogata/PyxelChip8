# Mastermind (4 row) for CHIP-8

## Introduction

The 4 row version of mastermind is a game where you can guess 4 numbers from 1 to 6. 
You can try 10 times. 
If both the value and position of the number match, a "dotted bar" is displayed at the bottom, 
and if only the value matches, a "white bar" is displayed at the bottom. 
Please guess the 4 numbers referring to the hint.

## Revisions

### Ver. 3

I changed the number font of the 4 row version of mastermind. 
I started making it with the motif of "Mahjong tile (circle tile)", 
but it became like "Cosmic language" engraved on a mysterious metal in the UFO special feature of Mr. Junichi Yaoi. 
With 4x5 pixels, "Hanafuda" was difficult and abandoned.

### Ver. 2

I changed the number font of the 4 row version of mastermind to be a little fashionable. 
I also made dice and mahjong tile versions, but I couldn't express them well with 4x5 pixels. 
After all Mr. Dotman is great. 
Next, let's make a slightly Japanese-style "Hanafuda" version.

### Ver. 1

I have reprinted mastermind in octo assembly language. 
Two types of mastermind have been developed in the past, 5 row version and 4 row version. 
Here, the 4 row version of the binary is decompiled 
and the comments of the 5 row version published in the magazine Viper (Volume 1, Issue 7, pp.22-26) are added.
