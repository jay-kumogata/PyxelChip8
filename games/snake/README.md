# Snake for CHIP-8

## Introduction

It is a famous game where you control a snake and eat food. 
Each time you eat food, the snake grows longer.

## How to Controll

Use the [W] / [S] / [A] / [D] keys to move up / down / left / right. 

## Remarks

I also ported [snake](https://github.com/massung/CHIP-8/blob/master/games/sources/snake.c8) to octo assembly language. 
Hustle (1977 / Gremlin) might be the original.
At that time, there was a ported version of NEC's PC-8001.
