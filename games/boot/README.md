# Boot demo for CHIP-8

## Introduction

I also reprinted [boot](https://github.com/massung/CHIP-8/blob/master/games/sources/boot.c8) to octo assembly language.

## How to play

You can play [in your browser](https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/index.html?key=cYnRGjHz).

## Remarks

Originally, it is a demo that is displayed when the image is not specified in the Chip8 emulator. 
The original logo was "CHIP-8", but I drew the name in the 3x4 pixel alphabet. 
The character "m" couldn't be represented by 3x4 pixels, so I had a little trouble.
